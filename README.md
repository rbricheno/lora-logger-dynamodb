# LoRa Logger DynamoDB
Log information about forwarded LoRaWAN packets.

Work in progress.

The LoRa Logger DynamoDB utility logs [Semtech packet-forwarder](https://github.com/lora-net/packet_forwarder)
UDP data to a DynamoDB database. It is based on, and intended to work with, the
[LoRa Packet Multiplexer](https://github.com/brocaar/lora-packet-multiplexer)
which is part of the [LoRa Server project](https://www.loraserver.io).
